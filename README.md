# Investigations
Screenshots and IOCs from my "investigations" into scams, phishing, and malware. <br>
Mainly for records purposes - and as a backup of the data on my computer - but also to give me something to do if I ever get bored <br>
The reports are sorted by date; so to find the reports for 24/10/2021, you would go to [/2021/10/24/](https://github.com/iam-py-test/investigations/tree/main/2021/10/24) <br><br>
As 99%-100% of the domains listed in here are dangerous (scams, malware, etc), I _strongly_ recommend you do not visit any of them _ever_.
